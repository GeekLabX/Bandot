Bandot is a decentralized and smart contract management stable coin that holders can use to collateralize their flowable digital assets.

Users between parachains can convert to a proprietary smart token by bailing the corresponding number of BDTs to the Bandot repeater. Using the interconnection of Bandot network service gateways to form a smart token circulation network, the token economy between different parachains can be exchanged for instant and safer and more convenient.

From the perspective of this article, a trustworthy stabilization mechanism may not only reduce the risk of our existing major redemption methods, but also have a great chance to function as a value storage tool.

The Bandot protocol supports value interoperability between different parachains, enabling the trading on the Polkadot chain to be quickly traded and circulated. Users can issue smart tokens through the Bandot protocol and run them on parachains, automatically redeeming through the value anchoring of the Bandot algorithm and the pass-through on the parachains of the Polkadot Ecology. The prosperity of the general economy and the ease of circulation can reduce transaction costs. It will be better able to serve dApp development to enable developers to better design and distribute their own decentralized applications.

For dApp, the application of the certificate requires a reasonable design, and the Token will have different demands according to the user scale and development stage of the project. For dApp, Token's free circulation, fixed exchange rate, and independent pass policy are constantly improving and balancing.

The bottom layer of Polkadot provides us with the basis for cross-chain communication, so we don't have to spend a lot of effort to develop the underlying framework. On the basis of Polkadot, it provides us with a strong cross-chain infrastructure prospect and realizes a cross-chain solution. At the same time, the project Bandot serves as the payment and circulation value medium in the Polkadot ecosystem and promotes the application of the project.

All in all, stability and anti-censorship are desirable. Programmability provides a new solution to the traditional drawbacks of capital gains. The demand for a stable and fully functional digital coin may be high. The network effect may produce a small number of outstanding stable digital currencies, each of which will face the challenges of the market and channels. Of all the unproven assumptions, the possibility of creating a durable and stable digital goods still exists, so technology itself is the first challenge facing the industry.
